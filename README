Run from command line as

python3 -m run <domain> <num_processes>

<domain> is the domain to be mapped, <num_processes> is the number of processes to use.
Defaults to 2. More allows parallel requests, the most expensive part of the code if
run in serial. Must be greater than 2.

If I had more time, I would unit test the parallelism control logic, but I've never
written unit tests for those, and I think I can see how.
