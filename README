The aim is a very basic site map generator using only native Python things. I don't have much experience of requests or OO in paralell processing, unittested environments. Only hacking during my PhD really.

- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20887555/dead-simple-example-of-using-multiprocessing-queue-pool-and-locking - 2nd answer has a good design patter
- also, ideas here https://pymotw.com/2/multiprocessing/communication.html
Move from urllib3 to urllib wherever I use it (urllib3 isn't inbuilt to python)
There are more cases than just 'text/html' - also 'text/html; charset=utf-8' for example."
Write a better integration test on my github.io site
